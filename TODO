Fix DNSSD on Mac OS X

Audit remaining GSoC patch:
--- dmap-db.c
--- dmap-share.c
--- dacp-player.c
--- dacp-player.h
--- dacp-share.c
--- dacp-share.h

Functions that could be simplified:
	compare_record_property()
	apply_filter()/_dmap_share_build_filter()

Add support for DMAP_CC_MSUP, dmap.supportsupdate

Something odd (as best as I can remember):
	TunesRemote+ on Android emulator
	Ryhthmbox on same machine
	Two network interfaces (i.e., _touch-remote._tcp listed twice by avahi-browse)
	Rhythmbox:
		Remote listed twice
		If "wrong" remote selected:
			entry_insert_text_cb has service_name set to garbled value
			mdns_remote_added has service_name set to correct value

Where to handle DACP-specific stuff in dmap-mdns-browser-avahi.c?

Does, e.g., handle_server_info need user_data parameter?

Complete DACP code and push Rhythmbox patch

Reduce the memory usage while building response to media list query.

Replace dmap-md5.[ch] with GChecksum.

Ensure client test catches newly shared files?

Do transcode based on client?

Complete Mac OS X Zeroconf backend as an alternative to avahi
	Finish browser side support.
	Update MacPorts port to no longer require avahi.

Fix seeking.

Documentation, see README (put documentation in test code?).

Clean up test_dmap_server.
	Fix code that determines path of test.jpeg.

See FIXME's in dmap-share.c, daap-share.c, daap-record.c and dpap-share.c.

Comment purpose of each source file and describe interfaces, using test
programs as examples.

Version 3:
	Use yacc
