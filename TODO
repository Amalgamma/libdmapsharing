Reduce memory needed to send entire listing to client:
	Can we predict length of mlcl?
		dmapd-structure.c: what does this mean in the case of MLCL: guint32 size = GINT32_TO_BE (item->size);

	dmap-share.c.../1/items use chunked response see daap-share.c:databases_items_xxx() / send_chunked_file()
		collect ID's into list
		header-complete callback, send preamble
		chunk-complete callback (modify add_entry_to_mlcl into callback) take ID list as user_data
			for each callback, pull an ID off list and write it
			once list is empty, done
	
	SHOULD THIS STUFF BE USED IN NEW SCHEME? HOW TO HANDLE SERIALIZING MLCL?
	eventually, get rid of?
		dmap_structure_serialize
		dmap_structure_serialize_node
		dmap_structure_add

Fix DNSSD on Mac OS X

Audit remaining GSoC patch:
--- dmap-db.c
--- dmap-share.c
--- dacp-player.c
--- dacp-player.h
--- dacp-share.c
--- dacp-share.h

Functions that could be simplified:
	compare_record_property()
	apply_filter()/_dmap_share_build_filter()

Add support for DMAP_CC_MSUP, dmap.supportsupdate

Something odd (as best as I can remember):
	TunesRemote+ on Android emulator
	Ryhthmbox on same machine
	Two network interfaces (i.e., _touch-remote._tcp listed twice by avahi-browse)
	Rhythmbox:
		Remote listed twice
		If "wrong" remote selected:
			entry_insert_text_cb has service_name set to garbled value
			mdns_remote_added has service_name set to correct value

Where to handle DACP-specific stuff in dmap-mdns-browser-avahi.c?

Does, e.g., handle_server_info need user_data parameter?

Complete DACP code and push Rhythmbox patch

Reduce the memory usage while building response to media list query.

Replace dmap-md5.[ch] with GChecksum.

Ensure client test catches newly shared files?

Do transcode based on client?

Complete Mac OS X Zeroconf backend as an alternative to avahi
	Finish browser side support.
	Update MacPorts port to no longer require avahi.

Fix seeking.

Documentation, see README (put documentation in test code?).

Clean up test_dmap_server.
	Fix code that determines path of test.jpeg.

See FIXME's in dmap-share.c, daap-share.c, daap-record.c and dpap-share.c.

Comment purpose of each source file and describe interfaces, using test
programs as examples.

Version 3:
	Use yacc
